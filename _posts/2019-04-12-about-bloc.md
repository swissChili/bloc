title:  "About Bloc"
---

This is bloc, a tiny Jekyll theme inspired by classic web design.
Unlike some monolithic Jekyll themes, bloc aims to be tiny and simple.
No 30kb JavaScript runtime, not even any large CSS, the entire theme
is styled in under 100 lines of sass.

Here are some fancy things to show off bloc's styling:

## Code Blocks

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void greet(const char *name)
{
  printf("Hello, %s!\n", name);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  greet("world");
}
```

## Typography

This is some **bold** text, and some in *italics*. Even ~~strikethrough~~!
Bloc uses the **IBM Plex Serif** font face for most text, and `IBM Plex Mono`
for code. The text is clear and easy to read, and the constrasting symbols
make the code easier to read.

> This is a quote

And some more text, seperated with an `<hr />`
